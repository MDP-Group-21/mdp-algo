          1. Note: Not to be used for actual run.<br/>
          2. Requires IDLE and wampserver to run.<br/>
            2a. Put the HTML + js file into the 'www' folder of your wampserver directory to run<br/>
            2b. Change the last line in the Python code to suit the folder to open the HTML file from.<br/>

##### To do: <br/>
- [X] Change simulation input to hex
- [X] Adapt code for week 8 run (Almost there)
- [X] Begin working on integration (With RPI)
- [ ] Adapt code for burst mode
- [ ] Improve step evaluation to include turning as 1 ste
